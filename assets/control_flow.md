In our daily life, we can press the switch to light up or turn off the lamp. But what if you want to control the lamp with Pico so that it can turn off automatically after ten minutes?

A relay can help you accomplish this idea.

A relay is actually a special kind of switch that is controlled by one side of the circuit (usually a low-voltage circuit) and used to control the other side of the circuit (usually a high-voltage circuit). This makes it practical to modify our home appliances to be controlled by a program, to become smart devices, or even to access the Internet.
